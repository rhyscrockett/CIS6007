Consider the sensor_data.csv file and write a program to read and extract
temperature and light level values in a suitable structure E.g., SensorReading.

Use a suitable container to store a collection of sensor readings and write functions to
display them.

Note: consider using different structures such as map, set, and vectors to store this
collection and compare their performance for following operations.

Implement the following functions with the aid of either functors or lambda expressions:

Obtain the average temperature and humidity levels

Obtain the number of days the temperature went higher than 30 degrees. 

Find the minimum and maximum temperature and light level values for a givendate.
