Create two threads to generate temperature and light levels as functions using a random
number generator and populate a common vector with the data.
The frequency of number generation should be a command line argument.
Consider the sample structure given

Struct readings{
string type;
double value;
Std::time_t timestamp;
};
Vector<readings> sensor_data;
Implement functions to display the data.
// temp or light
// value
// timestamp

Modify the program to pass the generated sensor readings to a message queue which is
consumed by a smart home application. If the reading is temperature the application adjusts the
room temperature. If the reading is light level, the application controls room light level.
Note: simulate this scenario of control by printing the adjustment made onto standard
output
Note: consider smart home application as another thread running along side
temperature and light sensor threads.
Hint: An example to use time_t in <ctime> and converting chrono system time is given
below.
